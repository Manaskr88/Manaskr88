Hello! My name is Manas kumar , and I am currently a first-year B.Tech CSE student.

My programming skills are still developing, but I have already acquired some knowledge in Python and basic web development. Here is a brief overview of my programming skills:
-Basic knowledge of Python
-Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I have previously worked on a personal project, a simple web clone. The project allowed me to practice and demonstrate my knowledge of  HTML, and CSS. The web application used a combinations of frame, tags, style etc. During this project, I learned to work with different components of the applications.
